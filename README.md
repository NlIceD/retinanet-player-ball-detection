# RetinaNet Player and Ball Detection

This project shows you how you can build a Computer Vision model that can detect players and ball in overhead camera images using RetinaNet. 

This project uses Fizyr's awesome keras-retinanet implementation, and applies it to Haizaha's Soccer Player and Ball Detection free dataset.
